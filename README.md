# MacroKeys
A small macro side keyboard based on a Teensy 3.1

## Case
The case for the project can be found on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2953199.

## Software
Unfortunately the Teensy board supports currently on up to Arduino IDE 1.8.5.

## Hardare
I used a Teensy 3.1: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html
But the newer Teensy versions should work as well.
Another options would be an Adafruit Feather board (https://www.adafruit.com/feather) or an Arduino Micro (https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-micro)  (both not tested, maybe software has to be changed).

Switches: I used gateron brown (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-Mechanical-keyboard-cherry-clone-gateron-mx-switch-transparent-case-mx-brown-blue-red-switch/32812949681.html)

Matrix: The keymatrix is a 3 x 4 one.
